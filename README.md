# Bank 5-3 Airgead Bank App

# Summary of the project and what needs to be solved
I created an app for the Airgead Bank that calculates the final balance in a bank account over a certain number of years, with or without a monthly deposit. 
The user would input values for the required variables such as the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years.

# The part of my code that I did particularly well in
If the ability to view my Airgead Bank app code, you would see that I successfully divided the code into separate functions with well-defined responsibilities.
These separate functions were for calculating the balance with the monthly deposit and without the monthly deposit. 
Also, I simply used the correct manipulators in my code to give a precise and readable output.

# Things I could have done to improve my code
Looking back at my code and what I have learned from the past 6 months of coding. 
I could have enhanced my code for the Airgead Bank app by creating a function that ensures valid inputs for the parameters. 
This would ensure that the User would have to input a positive number if they would like to the program work correctly.

# Difficulties of this project were
For myself, there was little difficulty when it came to this project but if I had to choose one it would be implementing the calculation of the balance with a monthly deposit.
As I remember struggling a little when it came to creating the correct nested loop for my app. 
Once I figured it out, it was pretty simple and was similar in code obviously to the calculation of the balance without a monthly deposit.

# Skills from this project that I will continue to use
I feel as if I gained many skills and plenty of knowledge from the Airgead Bank App project. Such as really understanding and using input/output handling in C++.
As well my code is clearly readable and easily updatable due to the clear transparency and use of each function. I always include short but detailed notes on functions. 
This project in my mind should make it easier for me now to work on other projects that require calculating and user input processing.
